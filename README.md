# CS166 Project Part 3

## Setup

To start, execute the following commands inside of `sql/scripts`:

```
source ./startPostgreSQL.sh
source ./createPostgreDB.sh
source ./create_db.sh
```

The previous commands will start the PostgreSql server, create the DB, and populate it with data.

## Running the Program

Inside of `java/scripts` there is a file, `compile.sh`, that is used to compile `ProfNetwork.java` (found in `java/src`).
